*"It's been a long, hard haul, but I'm getting better.
I'm working hard, lots of therapy -- speech therapy, physical therapy, and yoga too. 
But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make the world a better place, and you can too. 
Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best."*

>* Every injury is different. It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable. ***历史决定论的贫困***, Karl Popper
>* The new one -- better, stronger, tougher. 北冥重生
>* aphasia, which is difficulty with communication. The toughest challenge for you during this recovery is **Talking**. Really hard. Really. 看得懂英文，却听不懂，更说不出。。
>* We met in Vancouver, at the airport, on a trip that we were both taking to **China**, that I would actually, from my background, I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would — 
GG: Fact-finding mission.
MK: She would call it an important fact-finding mission. She was a state senator at the time, and we met here, at the airport, before a trip to China.
PM: Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance?
GG: No, no, no. (Laughter) A good friend.
MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.
GG: Yes. (Laughter)
MK: And then she invited me on, about a year or so later, she invited me on a date. Where'd we go, Gabby?
GG: **Death row**. 
MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona, which was just outside Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody else to go with her, and I'm like, "Of course I want to go to death row." So that was our first date. We've been together ever since. 
GG: Yes.

>* Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.
MK: I thought we always had a very special relationship. We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. 
GG: Stronger.
>* What did you like best about being in Congress?
GG: Fast pace. Fast pace.
>* whenever she was awake she was working. [TED-2014-Gilbert-Creative][2]：there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself.
>* She was the biggest supporter of my career. 男人背后的人
>* she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time. 南方芝麻糊，熟悉的味道
>* what have you learned from your experiences the past few years?
MK: Yeah, what have you learned? 
GG: Deeper. Deeper.
*Better，Stronger，and Tougher*
>* I think when something tragic happens in a family, it can pull people together. 患难见真情

>* We're gun owners, we support gun rights. At the same time, we've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that. 
[TED-2014-Snowden-Internet][3]: We don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives.
>* Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best.
