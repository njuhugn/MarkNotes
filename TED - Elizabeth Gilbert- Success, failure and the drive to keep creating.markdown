*Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. So that might be creativity, it might be family, it might be invention, adventure, faith, service, it might be raising corgis, I don't know, your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential.*

>* if I had given up writing, I would have lost my beloved vocation.
>* creativity survived its own success;creativity can survive its own failure.
>* going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home, because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing, which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego, which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself. 我思故我在。我写故我在。

So that might be creativity, it might be family, it might be invention, adventure, faith, service, it might be raising corgis, I don't know, your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential. 如果你爱TA胜过爱你自己，那就是你的Home
>* I don't know where you rightfully live, but I know that there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself. *Everyone is good at something.*
>* your job is to **fight** your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done, by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next. **The Fighting Boys**
