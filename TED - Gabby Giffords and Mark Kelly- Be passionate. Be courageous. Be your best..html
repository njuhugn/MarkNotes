<p><em>"It's been a long, hard haul, but I'm getting better. <br>
I'm working hard, lots of therapy -- speech therapy, physical therapy, and yoga too.  <br>
But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make the world a better place, and you can too.  <br>
Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best."</em></p>

  <li>We met in Vancouver, at the airport, on a trip that we were both taking to <strong>China</strong>, that I would actually, from my background, I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would —  <br>
  GG: Fact-finding mission. <br>
  MK: She would call it an important fact-finding mission. She was a state senator at the time, and we met here, at the airport, before a trip to China. <br>
  PM: Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance? <br>
  GG: No, no, no. (Laughter) A good friend. <br>
  MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time. <br>
  GG: Yes. (Laughter) <br>
  MK: And then she invited me on, about a year or so later, she invited me on a date. Where'd we go, Gabby? <br>
  GG: <strong>Death row</strong>.  <br>
  MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona, which was just outside Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody else to go with her, and I'm like, "Of course I want to go to death row." So that was our first date. We've been together ever since.  <br>
  GG: Yes. <br>

  <li>what have you learned from your experiences the past few years? <br>
  MK: Yeah, what have you learned?  <br>
  GG: Deeper. Deeper. <br>
  <em>Better，Stronger，and Tougher</em></li>
  <li>I think when something tragic happens in a family, it can pull people together. 患难见真情</li>
  <li>how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook? <br>
  GG: I want to make the world a better place.</li>
  <li>We're gun owners, we support gun rights. At the same time, we've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that.  <br>

  <li>Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best.</li>
